PYSOLATE
========

Game Isolate written in python, a board game.


INTRODUCTION
============

Isolate is a board game played by two players. The game starts with two pawns 
placed at the two corners (upper left and lower right) of a 8x8 grid. 

A pawn can visit any tile on board as long as that tile is not mined (visited) 
or occupied by the opponent's pawn. In addition, a pawn can only move along
STRAIGHT lines, which means a pawn can visit the tiles around it in AT MOST 
8 directions. Lastly, crossing mined (visited) tile(s) is forbidden, which means
a pawn can only move across empty tiles.

The goal of this game is to isolate the opponent's pawn by leaving mines and 
occupying tiles to block the opponent's ways until he/she can no longer moves.


INSTRUCTION
===========

To move a pawn, you can either touch on the tile you want to move to or drag
and drop your pawn on the desired spot. Or, your can use the keys on Dpad 
(including directional keys and the enter key) to make the move.

There will be music playing during the game, also, valid tiles to move will 
be shown in a different color than ordinary tiles; both by default. You can
change these settings by changing the options in the setting's menu. To enter
setting's menu, press the menu key on the phone in the game's main menu.

Have fun and enjoy it!
